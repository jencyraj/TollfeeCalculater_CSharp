# TollfeeCalculater_CandidateTest


Background
Your city has decided to implement toll fees for vechicles in order to reduce traffic congestion during rush hours. This is the current draft of requirements:

Fees will differ between 8 SEK and 18 SEK, depending on the time of day (SEK = swedish currency)
Rush-hour traffic will render the highest fee. The fee that you have to pay is based on these hours:
06:00–06:29, 9 SEK
06:30–06:59, 16 SEK
07:00–07:59, 22 SEK
08:00–08:29, 16 SEK
08:30–14:59, 9 SEK
15:00–15:29, 16 SEK
15:30–16:59, 22 SEK
17:00–17:59, 16 SEK
18:00–18:29, 9 SEK
18:30–05:59, 0 SEK
The maximum fee for one day is 60 SEK
A vehicle should only be charged once an hour
Some vehicle types are toll-free (meaning they don't have have any fee)
Weekends and holidays are toll-free (meaning they don't have have any fee)
Task
The current code is legacy code that never made it to production. There are plenty of room for improvements. Your task is to make this code production ready and make sure that it meets all the requirements above.

This test is intended to provide insight into the range of your skill set. It is not a pass/fail test. Please do what you can. Feel free to refactor any code you want and rewrite all parts that you think needs to be rewritten.

Requirements:

Create a Visual Studio solution (sln) that contains your code
The code should be easy to maintain and extend with new features in the future
The code must have unit tests that prove that the above requirements are met
